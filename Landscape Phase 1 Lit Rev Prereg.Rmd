    "Researchers usually work in silos, without much awareness of or access to what's going on in other fields. The solitary nature of research often means that both within and across disciplines, the sharing of information or best practices relating to reproducible scientific methods is difficult. This can lead to a problem of reinventing the wheel whilst also resulting in knowledge that is biased or misleading (e.g., believing some finding is unique to a certain field when itâ€™s not). Collating an interdisciplinary database of OS literature would help address this issue because it can remove the information barriers and expedite the accumulation of evidence. It is particularly necessary to build one for OS as it is still an emerging topic in many disciplines. Efforts are often isolated and scattered in fields where OS is still a lesser known topic. The lack of coordinated efforts across and within disciplines can give rise to many issues that hinder the progress of science. One commonly acknowledged issue is the jingle-jangle fallacy where the same terms are used to convey different meanings and the same meaning to different terms. For instance, preregistration can be defined as an uneditable and timestamped version of a research protocol, while in healthcare fields pre-registration is a fast-track course that qualifies students into a medical profession. The Glossary project at FORRT is specifically targeted to address this issue by building one central hub with OS terms (Parsons et al., 2022). This project shares the same vision but works towards addressing the issue concerning the literature base. Through mapping the landscape of OS literature, an up-to-date picture can be revealed, facilitating a transparent and timely understanding of current developments of OS in different fields. Therefore, it is important to make efforts to integrate diverse literatures, search for commonalities and uniqueness, identify gaps and areas of consensus. This initiative helps us consolidate what is known about OS and sets us towards cumulative OS. Once a first version of this database has been established, it can be dynamically updated whenever new entries are necessary, possibly using more automated methods.",

Grey literature (e.g., OSF preprints, research in languages other than English) was considered during our exploration phase but we decided against it because the data structure is very different from WoS, most requiring manual downloading, which makes merging difficult and workload unmanageable. Our plan is to incrementally incorporate grey literature in later stages (e.g., as separate/complementary analysis).
2. We only use the three most general terms regarding open scholarship to keep our search results general, which allows for a more meaningful keyword co-occurrence analysis.
3. We only use title, author keyword and keyword plus as the search fields, to narrow down our search results. During the exploration stage, we tried including abstract as the search fields and the quality of the results were staggering, with some only mentioned OS in passing, which did not fit our inclusion criteria. Considering the volume of results was still large (> 7,000) after we excluded abstract from the search field, we believe this is a reasonable strategy.",
